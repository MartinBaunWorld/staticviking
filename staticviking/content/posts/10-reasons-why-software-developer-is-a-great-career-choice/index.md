Software development is a popular and fast-rising career path.  Here are ten reasons why.

## Prelude

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the rise of technology and the boom of the digital age. Most people turned to the Internet for work and school. There has never been a better time to begin a software developer career.

I'll explore why software development is a career worth pursuing. 

## Is it hard to become a software developer?

It can be challenging for most, but it is achievable with the right approach and dedication. You'll require a solid foundation in computer science, mathematics, and a working knowledge of programming languages.

Enrolling for a computer science degree is the most common way to achieve this. Many online courses and boot camps are teaching these foundations, with many teaching free of charge.

You'll need strong problem-solving, communication skills, and creativity to lead a successful career as a software developer. Be willing to learn continuously, as it is an ever-evolving field.

## How many hours do software developers work?

The work hours of a software engineer vary depending on their employer, the project they're working on, or their job station. Most developers work full-time, averaging about 35 to 40 hours a week. It is common to find them working longer hours, especially when their projects have tight deadlines or when they address bugs in production.

Most companies allow developers to work remotely or offer them flexible work schedules. This means developers can work from anywhere and adjust their hours to suit their hours better.

## Why choose a software developer career?

There are numerous benefits of being a software developer. These include:

### Software developers are in high demand
More businesses and industries rely on the Internet for their operations. They need people who can create, maintain, and improve the software solutions that power them.

### Great for those who like problem-solving

This career entails solving real-world problems using software. Youâ€™ll use your analytical skills to break down vague and seemingly complex issues into bite-sized, understandable pieces. You'll also employ your creativity to design and implement solutions that meet the end user's needs.

Climbing the career ladder involves continually learning and adapting to new technologies. You'll face new and unique challenges, providing intellectual stimulation.

### Creative and collaborative profession

Software developers often work in teams to design, build, and maintain software applications. This calls for effective communication, as well as continuous collaboration. One popular coding technique is pair programming, where two developers work on the same code. Developers may also need to work with designers, product managers, and QA testers. This collaboration enhances their creativity, exposing them to multiple perspectives and ideas.

### Constantly learning something new

Technology is evolving at a rapid pace. Software developers are familiar with the latest industry trends and techniques to remain effective. This may involve learning new frameworks, libraries, tools, or programming languages.

Developers learn about new domains, APIs, and other products. These help them understand the context in which their applications will be used. This continuous learning process can be quite rewarding for your software developer career advancement.

### Project-based work structure

The work of a software developer is usually project-based, which means they can work on various tasks ranging from simple to complex. It requires intense focus, as they are often tasked with specific goals and deadlines.

The nature of their work bodes well for individuals who frown upon monotony in their work. Projects can vary in size and scope, which helps keep the work challenging and exciting.

### Ability to work remotely

Software developers can work from anywhere in the world. This leads to improved job satisfaction, as individuals work in the environments that best suit their work styles. It also saves commuting costs and time. Remote work provides time for family and other personal responsibilities, improving their work-life balance.

### Good career ladder and salary

Software development is a high-paying career. More than half of Glassdoor's ranking of the top 10 best jobs in America in 2022 is software engineering roles. Glassdoor averages the average pay for a developer in the US at $85,000 per year, with some senior roles paying upwards of $120,000 annually.

This career also offers exciting opportunities for advancement. Most people typically start with entry-level jobs as junior developers or software engineers. With experience and skills, they advance to senior developers, software architects, or technical leads.

Developers can also move into management as project managers and engineering directors. These roles call for strategic decision-making, personnel management, and business acumen.

### Visible results and satisfaction

Developers see the fruits of their labor when they deploy and launch their apps and software solutions. This results in improved job satisfaction and pride in their work. Nurturing such feelings has been known to inspire employee loyalty to the organization.

### Falls in a low-stress category

Software development is generally considered a low-stress profession. This is because developers have a high degree of autonomy in their work and are not typically involved in physical labor. The risk of injury or other occupational hazards is low. Most software development work can be done remotely. This helps reduce stress on the developer team and improve their work-life balance.

## Should you become a software developer?

Becoming a software developer is one of the most highly sought-after professions, and the demand is only projected to grow in the coming years. It is well-paying and low-stress. It provides numerous career advancement opportunities, and developers can attest to high job satisfaction. Becoming a software developer is worth considering.
